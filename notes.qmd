# Open Questions

With which enteties do we work? Do we work with points or lines? (if could split segment in street segments, this would make it quite straight forward.

How do we handle slope?
We have slope at every point from the digitales höhenmodell
We have altitude at every point from the digitales höhenmodell
We have calculated distance, slope and altitude differences between points
GPS-fixes, edges, nodes

We have these values summed per segment and cummulative between points

# challenges

Map matching does not work.
We need a better street map.
We need alternative segments from HERE
